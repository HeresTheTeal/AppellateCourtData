# Appellate Court Data
Python script for scraping appellate court data to deterimine authors of opinions and scrape opinion text.
Intended to be a private repository for pushing updates across machines and version logging. 
Note: On PC, change directories at top, add brute force CSV max size calculation, and declare encoding for "with open" lines. 

Master includes macOS and Windows versions, both final builds. 
Windows only differs with the note above - otherwise, output should be the same across both platforms.
Some errors still remain, but they are due to data inconsistencies and will be manually addressed.
When running either macOS or Windows versions, the only required setup should be declaring the directories.
